  * The `Classes, Objects and Variables` chapter
* [What happens when you call `SomeClass.new`?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10383535/in-ruby-whats-the-relationship-between-new-and-initialize-how-to-return-n)
* [Here is the first part of the lecture for Enumerable](https://ruby.hackbulgaria.com/lectures/02)
