# Semantic tweets

The task for this week will involve lots of tweets, API calls, and positive
vibes!

## TL;DR
Create an application that fetches tweets from user's Twitter feed (using
[Twitter's REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)) then tries to find
out which tweets are positive, neutral or negative. Do this processing by a
plain Ruby class called `TweetStatus`. How would you find out whether a tweet
is positive from it's content? I dunno, figure it out, lol :troll:.

## Requirements

You obviously need a Twitter account with lots of data in the feed. You'll also
have to register for the free Semantria service in order to use their
classification API.

## Restrictions

Make sure you don't use some fancy library wrapping the APIs. We'd like you to
work directly with the API provided by the service.

## Extended

In addition to the functionality above, you should add a form for posting new
tweets. The content of the tweet should first be passed through Semantria and
only if the sentiment of the tweet is positive it should be posted to Twitter.
