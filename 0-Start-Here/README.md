# Course Starting Pack

In order to be prepared for the course & start solving problems from day 1, you should:

* Install a text editor for start. You can pick [Sublime 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Read the entire about page from the official Ruby lang website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/)
* If you have knowledge in other languages, you can read [Ruby From Other Languages section](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/)
* [Try Ruby!](http://tryruby.org/) - This is an interactive tutorial to get you started with the basic language constructs. Get a feel of Ruby before the first excercise in HackBulgaria!

## Quick Start With Some Programming Concepts

* [What is a function in more mathematical terms by Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/algebra-functions/evaluating-functions/v/what-is-a-function)
* [A more formal understanding of functions by Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix_transformations/linear-transformations/v/a-more-formal-understanding-of-functions)
* [What is a function parameter?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming))
* [Algorithms and Asymptotic Notation by Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/asymptotic-notation/a/asymptotic-notation)

## Install Ruby

Our recommended setting for installing Ruby is to use rbenv + ruby-build:

You are going to need git. In order to install git, run the following command:

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

* [Guide for how to install rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#installation)
* [Guide for how to install ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build#installation)

After you have `rbenv` and `ruby-build`, you can do the following:

```
$ rbenv install 2.2.3
$ rbenv global 2.2.3
$ ruby --version
```

You should see Ruby's version 2.2.3

If you happen to be running on Windows, you have two options:

1. Install some Linux distribution. [Ubuntu is good for beginners](http://www.ubuntu.com/)
2. Use [ruby installer for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/). And after this, switch to Linux.

## Installing Linux

Before moving on and installing any Linux, **PLEASE BACKUP EVERYTHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU**.

Don't leave memories only on the hard drive of your PC / laptop. It will eventually fail and you will eventually lose everything that is not backed up.

Our suggestion is, use one or more of the following:

* [pCloud](https://www.pcloud.com/)
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
* [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org/)
* Other similar cloud services
