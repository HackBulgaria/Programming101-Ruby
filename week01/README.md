# Week 01 - Staring out with Ruby

Ruby is a very beautiful & strange at first language.

We are going to solve a lot of problems using it & making progress one step at a time. Don't expect the entire syntax from the first week :)

## Getting to know Ruby

* The first problem that you are going to face is to run the [hello.rb](hello.rb) file and examine the structures in it. This will give you clues for how to solve your problems.
* [If you wonder what kind of loop you can use, take a loot at that reference](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm)
* [As you will see both double and single quotes, check this for the difference](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6395288/double-vs-single-quotes)
