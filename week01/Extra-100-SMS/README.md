# 100 SMS

Before the smartphones, when you had to write some message, the keypads looked like that:

![Nokia 3310 Keypad](nokia.jpg)

For example, on such keypad, if you want to write **Ruby**, you had to press the following sequence of numbers:

```
7778822999
```

Each key contains some letters from the alphabet. And by pressing that key, you rotate the letters until you get to your desired one.

It's time to implement some encode / decode functions for the old keypads!

## `numbers_to_message(pressedSequence)`

First, implement the function that takes a list of integers - the sequence of numbers that have been pressed. The function should return the corresponding string of the message. 

There are a few special rules:

* If you press `1`, the next letter is going to be capitalized
* If you press `0`, this will insert a single white-space
* If you press a number and wait for a few seconds, the special breaking number `-1` enters the sequence. This is the way to write different letters from only one keypad!

Few examples:

```
numbers_to_message([2, -1, 2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2]) = "abc"
numbers_to_message([2, 2, 2, 2]) = "a"
numbers_to_message([1, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 6, 6, 3, 2])
=
"Ivo e panda"
```

## `message_to_numbers(messsage)`

This function takes a string - the `message` and returns the **minimal** keystrokes that you ned to write that `message`

Few examples:

```
message_to_numbers("abc") = [2, -1, 2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2]
message_to_numbers("a") = [2]
message_to_numbers("Ivo e panda")
=
[1, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 1, 7, 2, 6, 6, 3, 2]
message_to_numbers("aabbcc") = [2, -1, 2, -1, 2, 2, -1, 2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2]
```
