# FMI

2011 was a great year for Ruby. Colomb have just discovered the new earth, the
first space shuffle has landed on Mars and the dinosaurs have just went MIA. In
this great age of time, FMI had a great Ruby student, named Genadi.

Let me share my experience with you and present you with my [first] ever Ruby
homework.

:kiss: to [@skanev] and [@mitio] for this one.

## Resources

Enumerable is a gem. Go through its documentation. Array builds on top of it.

* http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Enumerable.html
* http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Array.html

## Handycap

Avoid using `Enumerable#each` and you get a sticker :)
