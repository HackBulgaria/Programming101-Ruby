# Roman Numerals

Roman literals are pain to process. Mentally, physically, sonically?1? There
is a reason for us to write the Arabic numbers we do today.

However, we can use them to impress our friends!

Let's work on an API that does this:

```ruby
>> Roman::LXXIII
=> 73
>> Roman::LXXIV
=> 74
>> Roman::LXXV
=> 75
```
