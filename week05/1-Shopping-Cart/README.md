# Shopping Card Problem - from 2011 FMI's Ruby course

The guys over the FMI Ruby course are amazing. They have great problems.

In order to test our skills with the object model & exceptions so far, we are going to implement a shopping card with various ways to give discounts.

Holidays are coming, so we should be ready for this :)
