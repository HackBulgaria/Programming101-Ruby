# Shopping Card Problem - from 2011 FMI's Ruby course

The guys over the FMI Ruby course are amazing. They have great problems.

In order to test our skills with the object model & exceptions so far, we are going to implement a shopping card with various ways to give discounts.

Holidays are coming, so we should be ready for this :)

## The Problem

[You can find the problem description here](http://2011.fmi.ruby.bg/tasks/3)

## Tests

Try to write tests for this problem. [You will find sample tests in the problem's folder here.](shopping_cart_test.rb)

In order to run tests, you need to have `shopping_cart.rb` file in the same directory as the tests. Then run:

```
$ ruby shopping_cart_test.rb
```
